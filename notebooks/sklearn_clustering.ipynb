      "# Clustering in Scikit-Learn\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the IPython notebook for clustering in scikit-learn that accompanies the \"A Beginner's Guide to Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn\" I gave at PyData NYC 2013 and will also be giving at PyTennessee 2014. The slides can be found at http://www.slideshare.net/SarahGuido/a-beginners-guide-to-machine-learning-with-scikitlearn. \n",

      "If you have questions, corrections, or suggestions for doing any of this in a better, more Pythonic way, please contact me.\n",

      "### Some Good Things to Know\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing to know is that the scikit-learn estimators take in continuous data only. I'm working with categorical data from the Car Evaluation dataset, so I have to transform these categorical values into continuous values.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing to know is that the process for almost everything we do is the same: create an object, fit it to data, and do something with it (predict, encode, binarize, etc).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Getting Data into Scikit-Learn\n",
      "\n",
      "I highly recommend you check out the IPython notebook I created for classification, which explains in detail how I got categorical data into scikit-learn."
